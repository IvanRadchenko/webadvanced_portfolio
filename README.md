#Учебная сборка Loftschool (выпускной проект Радченко Ивана №1)

1. Portoflio page ready. Had problems with Triangles - tryed to inline svg first but failed so did them with pure css
2. Blog page ready - There are few cyrillic texts. Do not pay attention to that. Everything will be in english. I did not install the cyrillic fonts
3. Login and Welcome forms as well as page are ready. Both of the forms are displayed - later on of them will be hidden and changed on Button clicks.
4. Half ready About me page - Having problems with Map inlining as a live background. Footer module refuses to nest in the body part.
- Need to finish the main page body part.
5. Most of the elements incapsulated into modules


Issues:
1. Possible false triangle positioning
2. Had few minor issues with merging requests with different changes on both ends (2 pcs)
3. Currentely there is a mix of REMs and PXs. Will use plugin to fix it later.
4. Mix of Flexbox and Static grid. Will need to turn the grid into Flexbox grid on this week for Responsiveness.
